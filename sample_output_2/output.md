# Health Risks of Putting Fluoride in Water

Fluoride is a naturally occurring compound that is often added to public water supplies to help prevent tooth decay. However, there has been ongoing debate about the potential health risks associated with fluoride exposure, particularly from water fluoridation. This article aims to explore these potential risks, focusing on the absorption and distribution of fluoride in the body, the link between water fluoridation and cancer risk, and the various sources of fluoride exposure.

## Conclusion

Based on the available research, the health risks associated with fluoride in water are minimal when consumed at recommended levels. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 milligrams/liter (mg/L) in drinking water for the prevention of dental caries[^1^]. Consuming fluoride at or below this level is generally considered safe and beneficial for dental health. However, excessive fluoride intake can lead to toxicity and adverse effects[^2^]. The potential link between water fluoridation and cancer is still under review, with current evidence suggesting that optimal fluoridation of drinking water does not pose a detectable cancer risk to humans[^3^].

## Health Risks of Fluoride

Fluoride is a compound that combines the element fluorine with another substance, often a metal[^4^]. Once inside the body, fluorides are absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract and tend to collect in areas high in calcium, such as the bones and teeth[^4^]. The major sources of fluoride for most people are water, other beverages, food, and fluoride-containing dental products[^4^]. There is controversy over the possible health effects of fluoride, with concerns ranging from scientific research to freedom of choice issues and government conspiracy theories[^4^].

## Fluoridation of Water

The process of adding fluoride to public water supplies, known as water fluoridation, began in the United States in 1945, after scientists noted that people living in areas with higher water fluoride levels had fewer cavities[^5^]. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L in drinking water for the prevention of dental caries[^1^]. This concentration is intended to balance protection from dental caries with limiting the risk of dental fluorosis[^1^].

## Water Fluoridation and Cancer Risk

The potential link between water fluoridation and cancer is still being reviewed. A 1990 study showed an increased number of osteosarcomas in male rats given high-fluoride water for 2 years[^6^]. However, other studies in humans and animals have not shown an association between fluoridated water and cancer[^6^]. A 1991 Public Health Service report, based on over 50 human population studies, concluded that optimal fluoridation of drinking water does not pose a detectable cancer risk to humans[^6^].

## Fluoride Exposure Sources

Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride[^7^]. Other sources of fluoride include tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes[^8^].

## Fluoride Absorption and Distribution

Approximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract[^9^]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained, and bones and teeth store about 99% of fluoride in the body[^9^]. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults[^9^].
