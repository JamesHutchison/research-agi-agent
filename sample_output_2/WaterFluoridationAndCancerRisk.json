[{"url": "https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html", "notes": "- Fluoride is a compound that combines the element fluorine with another substance, usually a metal. Some fluorides occur naturally in soil, air, or water, and the levels can vary widely. \n- All water contains some fluoride, and it is also found in food sources from some plants and animals. Once inside the body, fluorides are absorbed into the blood and tend to collect in areas high in calcium, such as the bones and teeth.\n- The major sources of fluoride for most people are water and other beverages, food, and fluoride-containing dental products. Dental products are generally not swallowed, so they are less likely to be of concern in terms of possible health issues.\n- Water fluoridation began in the United States in 1945, after scientists noted that people living in areas with higher water fluoride levels had fewer cavities. \n- Since 1962, the United States Public Health Service has recommended that public water supplies contain fluoride to help prevent tooth decay.\n- There is controversy about the possible health effects of water fluoridation, with concerns ranging from legitimate scientific research to freedom of choice issues and government conspiracy theories.\n- The potential link between water fluoridation and cancer is still being reviewed, and it is not addressed in this text as a position statement of the American Cancer Society."}, {"url": "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/myths/fluoridated-water-fact-sheet", "notes": "1. Fluoride is a compound composed of naturally occurring fluorine and one or more other elements, found in water and soil.\n2. In the 1940s, it was discovered that areas with naturally occurring fluoride levels of >1.0 ppm in water had fewer dental caries. Fluoride can prevent and reverse tooth decay.\n3. Ingested fluoride accumulates in teeth and bones.\n4. Water fluoridation is the process of adding fluoride to water supply to reach approximately 0.7 ppm, the optimal level for preventing tooth decay.\n5. The first city to implement community water fluoridation was Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1945. By 2008, over 72% of the U.S. population served by public water systems had access to fluoridated water.\n6. A potential link between fluoridated water and cancer risk has been debated. A 1990 study showed an increased number of osteosarcomas in male rats given high-fluoride water for 2 years.\n7. Other studies in humans and animals have not shown an association between fluoridated water and cancer.\n8. A 1991 Public Health Service report, based on over 50 human population studies, concluded that optimal fluoridation of drinking water does not pose a detectable cancer risk to humans."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547570/", "notes": "1. The U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) recommends an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 milligrams/liter (mg/L) in drinking water for the prevention of dental caries.\n2. This recommendation is an update from the previous range of 0.7\u20131.2 mg/L, which was based on outdoor air temperature.\n3. Fluoridation of public drinking water systems has been demonstrated as effective in reducing dental caries.\n4. The decision to fluoridate water systems is made by state and local governments.\n5. As of 2012, approximately 200 million people in the U.S. were served by community water systems that added fluoride to water.\n6. The new PHS recommendation of 0.7 mg/L is expected to reduce fluoride intake from water by approximately 25% and total fluoride intake by approximately 14%.\n7. The updated recommendation is due to new data on the prevalence of dental fluorosis, the relationship between water intake and outdoor temperature in children, and the contribution of fluoride in drinking water to total fluoride exposure in the U.S.\n8.
