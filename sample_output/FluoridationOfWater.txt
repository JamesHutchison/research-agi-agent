The U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 milligrams/liter (mg/L) in drinking water for optimal dental caries prevention.\n2. The fluoride concentration recommendation is a balance between protection from dental caries and limiting the risk of dental fluorosis.\n3. The decision to fluoridate water systems is made by state and local governments.\n4. As of 2012, approximately 200 million people in the U.S. were served by community water systems that added fluoride to water.\n5. The new PHS recommendation of 0.7 mg/L will reduce fluoride concentration in water systems by 0.1\u20130.5 mg/L.\n6. Implementation of the new recommendation is expected to lead to a reduction of approximately 25% in fluoride intake from drinking water alone and a reduction of approximately 14% in total fluoride intake.\n7. The updated PHS recommendation is based on new data addressing changes in the prevalence of dental fluorosis, the relationship between water intake and outdoor temperature in children, and the contribution of fluoride in drinking water to total fluoride exposure in the U.S."}, {"url": "https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html", "notes": "1. Fluoride is a compound that combines the element fluorine with another substance, usually a metal. It is found naturally in soil, air, or water, and in some plants and animals.\n2. Fluoride is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract and tends to collect in areas high in calcium, such as bones and teeth.\n3. Major sources of fluoride exposure are water, other beverages, food, and fluoride-containing dental products.\n4. Water fluoridation began in parts of the United States in 1945 after scientists noted that people living in areas with higher water fluoride levels had fewer cavities.\n5. In 1962, the United States Public Health Service recommended that public water supplies contain fluoride to help prevent tooth decay.\n6. There is controversy about the possible health effects of water fluoridation, with concerns ranging from scientific research to freedom of choice issues.\n7. The link between water fluoridation and cancer is a topic of investigation, but this document does not provide a definitive answer.\n8. Dental products containing fluoride are less likely to cause health issues as they are generally not swallowed."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195894/", "notes": "1. Fluoride is one of the most abundant elements found in nature, and water is the major dietary source of fluoride.\n2. Low fluoride intake is associated with the risk of dental caries.\n3. Fluoride was initially considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research showed its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay.\n4. Water fluoridation was once considered one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century.\n5. Fluoridation is not feasible or cost effective in many regions, especially rural areas, leading to alternative methods such as adding fluoride to milk and table salt.\n6. There are major concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity, leading several countries to ban fluoridation.\n7. Fluoride is the ionic form of fluorine, the thirteenth most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust, and is released into the environment naturally in both water and air.\n8. Other important sources of fluoride are tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes.\n9. Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine, and about 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth.\n10. The recommended intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men.\n11. Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density."}]
