They occur naturally in soil, air, or water, and also in food sources from some plants and animals.\n- Once inside the body, fluorides are absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract and tend to collect in areas high in calcium, such as the bones and teeth.\n- The major sources of fluoride for most people are water and other beverages, food, and fluoride-containing dental products.\n- Water fluoridation began in the United States in 1945, after scientists noted that people living in areas with higher water fluoride levels had fewer cavities.\n- In 1962, the United States Public Health Service recommended that public water supplies contain fluoride to help prevent tooth decay.\n- There is ongoing controversy about the possible health effects of fluoride, with concerns ranging from scientific research to freedom of choice issues to government conspiracy theories.\n- The link between water fluoridation and cancer is still under review, and other possible health effects of fluoridation (positive or negative) are not addressed in the provided content."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195894/", "notes": "1. Fluoride is one of the most abundant elements in nature and is found in water, which is its major dietary source.\n2. Low fluoride intake is associated with the risk of dental caries.\n3. Initially, fluoride was considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research showed its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay.\n4. Water fluoridation was considered one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century, but it is not feasible or cost effective in many regions.\n5. Other methods of introducing fluoride include adding it to milk and table salt.\n6. There are concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity, leading several countries to ban fluoridation.\n7. Fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine, with one-quarter to one-third taken up into calcified tissues, and the rest is lost in the urine.\n8. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth, and the amount steadily increases during life.\n9. The recommended intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men.\n10. It remains unclear whether fluoride is truly essential, although it may have some beneficial effects.\n11. Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density."}, {"url": "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154164", "notes": "1. Fluoride is found naturally in soil, water, and foods and is synthetically produced for use in drinking water, toothpaste, and mouthwashes.\n2. Fluoride is added to the municipal water supply to reduce tooth decay, especially in areas where fluoride levels are low.\n3. Excessive exposure to fluoride can lead to health issues such as dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, thyroid problems, and neurological problems.\n4. Dental fluorosis, which can cause discoloration in teeth, is a result of high fluoride exposure during childhood.\n5. Skeletal fluorosis, a bone disease caused by excess fluoride exposure, can result in pain, damage to bones and joints, and increased risk of fractures.\n6. Excess fluoride can damage the parathyroid gland, leading to hyperparathyroidism and resulting in lower calcium concentrations in bones, making them more susceptible to fractures.\n7. A 2017 report suggested that exposure to fluoride before birth could lead to poorer cognitive outcomes in the future, with higher fluoride levels associated with lower scores on IQ tests.\n8. In 2014, fluoride was documented as a neurotoxin that could be hazardous to child development."}]
