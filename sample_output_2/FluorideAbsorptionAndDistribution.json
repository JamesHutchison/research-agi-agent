It inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation.\n3. Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride.\n4. Approximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.\n5. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained, and bones and teeth store about 99% of fluoride in the body. The other 50% is excreted in urine.\n6. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults.\n7. Individual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth.\n8. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\n9. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has developed intake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients.\n10. Brewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil.\n11. Fluoride concentrations in breast milk and cow\u2019s milk are very low.\n12. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5651468/", "notes": "1. Fluoride is the 13th most abundant element on earth, found in water, soil, animals, and plants.\n2. It is present in all mineralized tissues of the body like enamel, dentin, and bone and is involved in several enzymatic reactions.\n3. Fluoride ions increase the stability of mineralized tissues and materials by decreasing the solubility of hydroxy-apatite mineral phase present in biomaterials and mineralized tissues.\n4. The protective effects of fluoride on dental health were first observed in 1930 with less tooth decay in communities consuming naturally fluoridated water.\n5. Fluoride was introduced into dentistry in 1940 and is now added to various consumer products, with water fluoridation being the most successful method.\n6. Fluoride delivery methods and related sources of dietary fluoride include fluoridated water, beverages, and tea.\n7. The recommended optimal level of fluoride in drinking water is 0.7 mg/l, but this can vary based on geographical areas.\n8. Ingestion of fluoride more than the recommended limit can lead to toxicity and adverse effects.\n9. The fluoride content in drinking waters of Pakistan varies significantly, ranging from < 0.1 ppm to >3 ppm.\n10. Understanding fluoride metabolism, toxic effects, and management of fluoride toxicity is crucial for assessing the health implications of fluoride in water."}, {"url": "https://pinellas.gov/water-fluoridation-facts/", "notes": "- Fluoride is added to water systems to improve oral health by strengthening tooth enamel and reducing tooth decay.\n- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for fluoride in drinking water at 4.0 parts per million (ppm), and a Secondary MCL at 2 ppm. \n- The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends a fluoride level of 0.7 to 1.2 ppm for dental health. \n- Pinellas County's water has a fluoride level of 0.7 ppm, which is well below the EPA's MCL.\n- Fluoride is safe when used properly. Over 50 years of evidence shows that fluoridated water can reduce or reverse tooth decay.\n- Fluoridation of water benefits the entire community, regardless of age, income, education level, or access to dental care.\n- Water fluoridation can reduce cavities in children's teeth by up to 60% and adult tooth decay by nearly 35%.\n- The cost of adding fluoride to the drinking water in Pinellas County is approximately $130,000 per year.\n- The Florida Department of Health advises against giving fluoride supplements to children in areas where the water is fluoridated.\n- Fluoride is considered a nutrient."}]
