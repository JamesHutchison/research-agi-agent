[{"url": "https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Fluoride-HealthProfessional/", "notes": "- Fluoride is a mineral naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement.\n- Fluoride inhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation.\n- Most of the fluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride.\n- Approximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.\n- In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained, and bones and teeth store about 99% of fluoride in the body.\n- In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults.\n- Fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth.\n- Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.\n- Brewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods, depending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up fluoride from soil.\n- Fluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be detected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002 to 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water.\n- Fluoride concentrations in cow\u2019s milk are also very low, ranging from 0.007 to 0.086 mg/L.\n- Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United States vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195894/", "notes": "1. Fluoride is one of the most abundant elements found in nature and water is the major dietary source of fluoride.\n2. Low fluoride intake is linked to the risk of dental caries.\n3. Initially, fluoride was considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research showed the importance of its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay.\n4. Water fluoridation was once heralded as one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century.\n5. Other methods of introducing fluoride to the population include adding fluoride to milk and table salt.\n6. There are major concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity, leading several countries to ban fluoridation.\n7. Fluoride is the ionic form of fluorine, it is released into the environment naturally in both water and air.\n8. Other sources of fluoride include tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes.\n9. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth, and the amount steadily increases during life.\n10. The adequate intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men.\n11. Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density."}, {"url": "https://fluoridealert.org/issues/sources/", "notes": "- Fluoride was first added to water in the 1940s to prevent tooth decay. At that time, no dental products contained fluoride.\n- Over the past 60 years, exposure to fluoride has increased due to the introduction of various fluoride products and other sources such as processed foods made with fluoridated water, fluoride-containing pesticides, bottled teas, fluorinated pharmaceuticals, teflon pans, and mechanically deboned chicken.\n- This increase in fluoride exposure has led to a rise in dental fluorosis, a tooth defect caused by excess fluoride intake.\n- In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended that water fluoridation programs should lower the levels of fluoride added to water from 1 ppm to 0.7 ppm. However, many children still ingest more fluoride than is recommended or safe.\n- Most fresh foods and fresh water contain very little fluoride. Consuming these can help reduce fluoride exposure.\n- Exceptions to this rule include seafood, tea, water from deep wells, and fresh fruit/vegetables sprayed with fluoride pesticides. These can contribute to increased fluoride intake.\n- The mass fluoridation of water has resulted in elevated levels of fluoride in many processed foods.\n- The issue with fluoride is not that children are receiving too little, but that they are receiving too much."}]
