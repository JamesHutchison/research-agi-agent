Fluoride is one of the most abundant elements in nature and is found in water, which is its major dietary source.\n2. Low fluoride intake is associated with the risk of dental caries.\n3. Fluoride was initially considered beneficial when given systemically during tooth development, but later research showed its topical effects in the prevention or treatment of dental caries and tooth decay.\n4. Water fluoridation was once considered one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century.\n5. Other methods of introducing fluoride to the population include adding it to milk and table salt.\n6. Concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity have led several countries to ban fluoridation.\n7. Fluoride is the ionic form of fluorine, and is released into the environment naturally in both water and air.\n8. Other sources of fluoride include tea, seafood with edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes.\n9. Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine, and about 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth.\n10. The recommended intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men.\n11. Once taken up into bone, fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density."}]
