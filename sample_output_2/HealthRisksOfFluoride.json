[{"url": "https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html", "notes": "1. Fluoride is a compound that combines the element fluorine with another substance, often a metal. \n2. Fluorides occur naturally in soil, air, or water, and the levels can vary widely. \n3. Fluoride is also found in food from some plants and animals.\n4. Once inside the body, fluorides are absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract and tend to collect in areas high in calcium, such as the bones and teeth.\n5. The major sources of fluoride for most people are water, other beverages, food, and fluoride-containing dental products.\n6. Water fluoridation began in some parts of the United States in 1945, after scientists noted that people living in areas with higher water fluoride levels had fewer cavities.\n7. In 1962, the United States Public Health Service recommended that public water supplies contain fluoride to help prevent tooth decay.\n8. There is controversy over the possible health effects of fluoride, with concerns ranging from scientific research to freedom of choice issues and government conspiracy theories.\n9. The link between water fluoridation and cancer is still under review. Other possible health effects of fluoridation are not addressed in the provided content.\n10. Dental products containing fluoride are less likely to be of concern in terms of possible health issues as they are generally not swallowed."}, {"url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195894/", "notes": "1. Fluoride is one of the most abundant elements found in nature and water is its major dietary source.\n2. Low fluoride intake is associated with the risk of dental caries.\n3. Fluoride was initially considered beneficial during tooth development, but later research highlighted its topical effects in preventing or treating dental caries and tooth decay.\n4. Water fluoridation was one of the best public health achievements in the twentieth century.\n5. Other methods of introducing fluoride to the population include adding it to milk and table salt.\n6. Concerns have been raised about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity, leading several countries to ban fluoridation.\n7. Fluoride is the ionic form of fluorine and is released into the environment naturally in both water and air.\n8. Other important sources of fluoride are tea, seafood that contains edible bones or shells, medicinal supplements, and fluoridated toothpastes.\n9. Dietary fluoride is absorbed rapidly in the stomach and small intestine. About 99% of total body fluoride is contained in bones and teeth.\n10. The recommended intake for fluoride is 0.7 mg daily for toddlers, rising to 3 mg daily for adult women and 4 mg daily for adult men.\n11. Fluoride appears to increase osteoblast activity and bone density, especially in the lumbar spine. \n12. The necessity of fluoride is unclear, but it may have some beneficial effects."}, {"url": "https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations", "notes": "1. The National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) are standards and treatment techniques that limit the levels of contaminants in drinking water to protect public health.\n2. The NPDWR applies to public water systems in the United States.\n3. High turbidity levels in water are often associated with higher levels of disease-causing microorganisms such as viruses, parasites, and some bacteria.\n4. Byproducts of drinking water disinfection can lead to health risks such as an increased risk of cancer, anemia, nervous system effects in infants and young children, and liver, kidney, or central nervous system problems.\n5. Disinfectants used in water can cause health issues such as eye/nose irritation, stomach discomfort, and anemia.\n6. The document does not specifically mention fluoride or its health risks, which is the main query. Therefore, further research is needed to fully address the user query."}]
