# Health Risks of Fluoridating Water

Fluoride is a naturally occurring compound that combines the element fluorine with another substance, usually a metal. It is found in soil, air, water, and in some plants and animals. Fluoride is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract and tends to collect in areas high in calcium, such as bones and teeth. The major sources of fluoride exposure are water, other beverages, food, and fluoride-containing dental products. Water fluoridation, the process of adding fluoride to public water supplies, began in the United States in 1945 after scientists noted that people living in areas with higher water fluoride levels had fewer cavities. However, there is ongoing controversy about the potential health risks associated with fluoride exposure, particularly from water fluoridation.

## Conclusion

While fluoride has been shown to have dental health benefits, excessive exposure to fluoride can lead to health issues such as dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, thyroid problems, and neurological problems. The link between water fluoridation and cancer is still under review. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a balance between the benefits of fluoride for dental health and the potential health risks associated with excessive fluoride exposure. Further research is needed to fully understand the health implications of water fluoridation.

## Health Risks of Fluoride

Fluoride is one of the most abundant elements in nature and is found in water, which is its major dietary source. Low fluoride intake is associated with the risk of dental caries. However, there are concerns about excessive fluoride intake and related toxicity. Excessive exposure to fluoride can lead to dental fluorosis, which can cause discoloration in teeth, and skeletal fluorosis, a bone disease that can result in pain, damage to bones and joints, and increased risk of fractures. Excess fluoride can also damage the parathyroid gland, leading to hyperparathyroidism and resulting in lower calcium concentrations in bones, making them more susceptible to fractures. A 2017 report suggested that exposure to fluoride before birth could lead to poorer cognitive outcomes in the future, with higher fluoride levels associated with lower scores on IQ tests. In 2014, fluoride was documented as a neurotoxin that could be hazardous to child development[^3^].

## Fluoridation of Water

The U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 milligrams/liter (mg/L) in drinking water for optimal dental caries prevention. The fluoride concentration recommendation is a balance between protection from dental caries and limiting the risk of dental fluorosis. As of 2012, approximately 200 million people in the U.S. were served by community water systems that added fluoride to water. The new PHS recommendation of 0.7 mg/L will reduce fluoride concentration in water systems by 0.1â€“0.5 mg/L. Implementation of the new recommendation is expected to lead to a reduction of approximately 25% in fluoride intake from drinking water alone and a reduction of approximately 14% in total fluoride intake[^4^].
